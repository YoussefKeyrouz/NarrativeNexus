    text: You find yourself at the edge of a mysterious forest. The ancient trees
      tower above you, their branches creating a canopy so thick that little sunlight
      reaches the forest floor. Two paths diverge before you.

  - id: dark_path
    text: You venture into the darker part of the forest. The air grows cold and
      you hear strange whispers in the wind. Suddenly, you come across an old, gnarled
      tree with a hollow in its trunk. Something glimmers inside.

    text: You follow the brighter path and soon emerge into a beautiful clearing
      filled with wildflowers. A crystal-clear stream runs through the center, and
      you can see fish swimming in its depths. You feel peaceful here.
    choices:
    - text: Rest by the stream and enjoy the tranquility

    text: Inside the hollow, you discover an ancient amulet that glows with a soft
      blue light. As you touch it, you feel a surge of wisdom and understanding.
      The forest no longer seems threatening, and you realize you've found something
      truly special. You have gained the Forest Guardian's blessing!

  - id: deeper_dark
    text: The deeper you go, the more lost you become. Eventually, you realize you're
      walking in circles. As night falls, you see lights in the distance and follow
      them back to the forest edge. You've learned that sometimes the safest choice
      is to turn back.

      of peace and clarity. Sometimes the best adventures are the quiet ones.

  - id: stream_adventure
    text: Following the stream leads you to a hidden waterfall. Behind the cascading
      water, you discover a small cave filled with beautiful crystals. You take one
      as a memento of your adventure and head home, knowing you'll return to this
      magical place again.
